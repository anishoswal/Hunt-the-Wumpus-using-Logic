# Description
- In this project, I have built a propositional logic (PL) agent capable of solving a variant of the Hunt The Wumpus game. This includes construction of the agent's knowledge base and implementing simple search routines the agent will use for planning.
- This is the solution for [**"Project 3: Using Logic to Hunt the Wumpus"**](http://www.sista.arizona.edu/~clayton/courses/ai/projects/wumpus/) licensed by the University of Arizona.
- Details regarding the files, working of the project, grading and my implementation can be found in the folder **"[wumpus](wumpus)"**
- There is a description file **"[Project-Description](Project-Description.pdf)"** which explains the tasks to be completed to get the project working.
